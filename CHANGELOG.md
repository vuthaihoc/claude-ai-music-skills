## [Unreleased]

### Changed (BREAKING)
- **ADM validation is now per-album opt-in via README frontmatter**
  (issue #353). Prior behavior: `mastering.adm_validation_enabled:
  true` in `~/.bitwize-music/config.yaml` would run ADM on every
  album. New behavior: the album's own README must include
  `mastering: { adm_validation_enabled: true }` in its frontmatter.
  Global `config.yaml` value is ignored for this key.

  Context: a significant chunk of mid-April 2026 went into building
  out the ADM pipeline — dark-casualty classification, per-track
  ceiling tightening, harmonic excitation in polish, warn-fallback
  sidecars, observability instrumentation (#347, #348, #349, #350,
  #351, #352) — only to discover at the end that ADM (Apple Digital
  Masters inter-sample peak validation) is an Apple-submission-tier
  niche that almost never matters for Suno-generated tracks. Suno
  output typically lacks the high-mid spectral content ADM requires,
  so most tracks ship dark-casualty-flagged regardless of how much
  the pipeline works at them.

  Rather than rip out the ADM infrastructure — the work has real
  value for the minority of albums that ARE submission-viable, and
  much of the underlying machinery (warn-fallback contract,
  per-track ceiling architecture, spectral regression guard) pays
  off on normal mastering too — it stays enabled per-album via
  frontmatter opt-in and defaults OFF for everyone else. No more
  silent 3-5 min/track overhead on runs that can't pass anyway.

  Operators who want ADM per album add `mastering: {
  adm_validation_enabled: true }` to the album's README
  frontmatter. Global `config.yaml` value is ignored for this
  key — it's the kind of decision that should live with the
  album, not with the operator's memory.

### Changed
- **Opus skills migrated from 4.6 to 4.7** (#319). Bumped `model:`
  frontmatter on the seven Opus-tier skills: `album-conceptualizer`,
  `lyric-refiner`, `lyric-reviewer`, `lyric-writer`, `researchers-legal`,
  `researchers-verifier`, `suno-engineer`. Co-author line in `CLAUDE.md`,
  `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `.github/SECURITY.md`, and `.github/pull_request_template.md`
  updated to `Claude Opus 4.7`. Docstring example in `tools/state/parsers.py`
  and schema example in `reference/state-schema.md` updated to use the
  current model ID. Sonnet/Haiku skills were already on current versions
  and required no changes. CI skill-frontmatter regex already admits 4.7
  IDs. No fixed thinking budgets exist in the repo, so 4.7's
  adaptive-thinking-only constraint is a no-op here.

### Added
- Per-album `mastering:` frontmatter block. Currently accepts
  `adm_validation_enabled`; future keys (ceiling_db, target_lufs,
  archival_enabled) will use the same block with standard
  frontmatter > config > default cascade.

### Fixed
- **Analyzer recommendations never reached polish** (root cause of
  "9/10 dark_casualty" on Suno albums despite enabling
  `adm_aware_excitation`). `analyze_mix_issues` keyed per-stem
  analyses by raw WAV filename stem (`01-Vocals`, `lead_vocals`, …)
  while `mix_track_stems` looked them up by canonical `STEM_NAMES`
  category (`vocals`, `drums`, …) from `discover_stems`. Keys
  never matched → `stem_recs = {}` → `overrides_applied: []` →
  excitation (and every other analyzer rec) was silently dropped.
  Bonus bug: `_analyze_one`'s
  `MIX_PRESETS["defaults"][stem_name]["excitation_db_when_dark"]`
  lookup also failed for the same reason, falling back to a
  hardcoded 2.0 for every stem regardless of type. Fix: analyzer
  now uses `discover_stems` to canonicalize before storing
  results, matching what polish looks up.
- ADM warn-fallback reporting was inaccurate when the loop
  short-circuited on the all-dark first check:
  - Warning text hardcoded `_ADM_MAX_CYCLES` (the configured max)
    instead of the actual executed count. Now reports
    `adm_cycles_executed` + `adm_tightening_cycles` separately and
    uses different wording when no tightening ran.
  - `ADM_VALIDATION.md` advice contradicted the pipeline verdict —
    recommended "Tighten true-peak ceiling by 0.5 dB and re-master"
    even when every failure was a dark-content casualty. The
    renderer now takes a `dark_casualty_filenames` kwarg and tailors
    the advice: all-dark failures get harmonic-excitation guidance,
    partial failures split advice by track class.
  - `per_track_decisions` dict on `adm_validation` stage output —
    records classification (`dark_casualty` / `tightenable`),
    outcome (`not_tightened` / `diverged` / `floor_reached` /
    `tightened`), reason, cycle, and final ceiling per clipping
    track. Survives the all-dark short-circuit path where
    `adm_history` and `track_ceilings` are both empty.

### Added
- Harmonic excitation in polish — `apply_harmonic_excitation`
  DSP primitive + per-stem `excitation_db` preset setting.
  When `defaults.analyzer.adm_aware_excitation: true` in the
  mix preset, dark-classified stems (high_mid band_energy < 10 %)
  get synthetic upper-harmonic content added during polish via
  tanh saturation → high-pass → attenuate → mix. Gives
  mastering's limiter room to work on dark Suno material that
  would otherwise ship with ADM inter-sample peak flags. Off by
  default — enable per preset when targeting ADM compliance.
  See `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-04-22-harmonic-excitation-polish.md`.
- Post-QC spectral regression guard — WARN when mastering pushed a
  track's `tinniness_ratio` (high_mid/mid) above 0.6 AND the ratio
  grew by more than +0.10 from pre-master. Preset-tunable via
  `post_qc_tinniness_warn_floor` and `post_qc_tinniness_warn_delta`.
  Flags the regressed track(s) in `ctx.stages["post_qc"]
  ["tinniness_regressions"]` and in `ctx.warnings`.
- `fix_dynamic` iterates up to 3 times to reach target LUFS,
  returning `converged` and `iterations_run` in metrics.
- `_stage_verification` emits `VERIFICATION_WARNINGS.md` sidecar and
  downgrades to `status: "warn"` when auto-recovery exhausts
  iterations. Pipeline continues instead of halting.
- **`/bitwize-music:promote-idea` skill + `promote_idea` MCP tool (#328)**: One-shot conversion of a `Pending` idea from `IDEAS.md` into a full album project. Auto-derives the album slug from the idea title (lowercase, ASCII-only, diacritics stripped, apostrophes elided, non-alphanumeric → hyphen) or accepts an explicit override. Calls `create_album_structure` with the idea's genre, injects the idea's `**Concept**` text into the new album `README.md` under a `## Concept` section, advances idea status `Pending → In Progress`, and adds a `**Promoted To**: <slug>` back-link in `IDEAS.md`. Distinct errors for missing idea, already-promoted idea, missing/invalid genre, and duplicate album slug. `documentary=True` flag mirrors `new-album` behavior (creates `RESEARCH.md` + `SOURCES.md`). The state indexer now also extracts `concept` and `promoted_to` fields from `IDEAS.md` so downstream tools can read the concept without re-parsing the markdown.
- **Genre-aware silence QC thresholds**: new `silence_leading_max_s` / `silence_trailing_max_s` preset fields (`tools/mastering/genre-presets.yaml`). Defaults 0.5 / 3.0 s. `electronic` and `edm` override `silence_leading_max_s: 1.5` so filter-sweep / build intros don't FAIL the silence gate. (#323 comment)
- **Click removal on every stem polish chain**: `vocals`, `backing_vocals`, `bass`, `synth`, `guitar`, `keyboard`, `strings`, `brass`, `woodwinds`, `other` now run click removal as the first step (was drums / percussion only). Shared `_apply_click_removal` helper standardizes the detector across all chains — `click_peak_ratio: 15.0` default matches the analyzer in `analyze_mix_issues` so polish and analysis report the same events. Genre presets (e.g. `electronic: 10.0`) overlay the default per-genre. Drum / percussion chains kept `cubic` repair (better spectral reconstruction on isolated transients); harmonic stems use `linear` repair (safer on dense mix content and vocal consonants). `mix_track_stems` dispatch unified — every processor now accepts `report` and surfaces `clicks_removed`. (#323 comment)
- `ctx.track_ceilings`, `ctx.dark_tracks`, `ctx.remaster_filenames`
  on `MasterAlbumCtx` — per-track ADM tightening state.
- `is_dark` field on `analyze_track` output (`band_energy['high_mid']
  < 10 %`).
- `ADM_VALIDATION.md` sidecar now includes `dark_casualties`,
  `tightened_tracks`, and per-track final `track_ceilings` in the
  adm_validation stage output.

### Fixed
- Auto-recovery path now writes at `output_sample_rate` (was using
  source rate, so 48 kHz polished sources produced mastered files
  at 48 kHz while the rest of the album was 96 kHz).
- `master_album` halting at `verification` when track-level auto-recovery
  couldn't converge. The docstring promised warn-fallback; the
  implementation now delivers it.
- **`master_album` status_update stage no longer brittle on re-masters (#335)**: The stage previously only promoted tracks from `Generated → Final` and appended a "Skipped: expected Generated" error for any other starting status. Combined with a hardcoded `status: "pass"` report this silently no-op'd the entire stage on any re-master of an album whose tracks weren't pinned at exactly `Generated` (Not Started, Sources Pending, Sources Verified, In Progress, Released — all hit this). The stage now promotes any non-terminal status (`Not Started`, `Sources Pending`, `Sources Verified`, `In Progress`, `Generated`) to `Final` because the mastered WAV is real and status should follow. `Final` and `Released` are left alone as terminal states; `Released` specifically is never demoted back to `Final` on a re-master. Tracks with an empty `path` (cache-staleness, no disk file) are now silently skipped instead of appending an error. Stage outcome is now classified honestly: `pass` when clean or idempotent, `partial` when some updates succeeded and some errors exist, `skipped` when nothing updated AND errors exist (was always `pass` before, masking real failures).
- **`/bitwize-music:lyric-refiner` no longer blocks on instrumental-mixed albums (#311)**: The refiner's former guard clause — "Track status `Not Started` or `Sources Pending` → error" — fired on any non-ready vocal track and stopped the whole run, even when other tracks were refineable. Replaced with a three-bucket triage (instrumental / not-ready / refineable): non-refineable tracks are silently skipped with a one-line note (`Skipping {track} — instrumental` or `Skipping {track} — no lyrics yet ({status})`), and the refiner processes whatever is left. Zero-refineable is now a clean informational exit, not a guard-clause failure. Added explicit `### Instrumental Guard` section to match the convention shared with `lyric-writer` / `lyric-reviewer` / `pronunciation-specialist`, and extended the `TestInstrumentalGuard.test_instrumental_guard_section` parametrize to cover `lyric-refiner`. Report header now shows both skip counters: `X of Y (Z instrumental skipped, W Not Started skipped)`.
- **qc_audio silence check (#321)**: Trailing silence followed by a sub-threshold noise-floor blip no longer gets misclassified as an internal gap. The silence detector now classifies each silent region by position AND by the amount of non-silent content between the region and the file edge — a region ending within 1s of the file end (with <300ms of non-silent content after it) counts as trailing, not internal. Unblocks the `master_album` / `polish_album` pre-QC gate on tracks with natural fade-outs.
- **analyze_mix_issues click detection (#323)**: Replaced the sample-wise `|diff| > 6·σ(diff)` detector with a windowed peak-to-RMS check (matches `qc_tracks._check_clicks`) at `peak_ratio=15` over 10 ms windows. The old detector flagged tens of thousands of "clicks" on every clean vocal, bass, and synth stem (vocal consonants and synth attacks have high instantaneous derivatives but spread their energy across a window), emitting `click_removal: true` recommendations that the polish pipeline silently ignored. The analyzer now only recommends click removal when genuine single-sample discontinuities exist.

### Changed
- `master_album` docstring enumerates halt vs warn-fallback
  conditions explicitly.
- **Logger names standardized to `__name__` (#268)**: All 12 MCP server modules that used `logging.getLogger("bitwize-music-state")` now use `logging.getLogger(__name__)`, giving hierarchical logger names (e.g., `handlers.processing.audio`) so operators can filter logs by module/subpackage. Affected: `server.py`, `handlers/{core,database,gates,maintenance,text_analysis}.py`, `handlers/processing/{audio,video,mixing,sheet_music,_album_stages,_helpers}.py`. Six `caplog` assertions in the test suite updated to reference the new module-hierarchical logger names.
- **Dense-transient genre click QC thresholds bumped** to match `idm`'s calibration (`click_peak_ratio: 10.0`, `click_fail_count: 30`, was 8.0/15). Applies to `electronic`, `edm`, `techno`, `drum-and-bass`, `jungle`, `dubstep`, `hardstyle`, `breakbeat`, `metal`, `industrial`, `trap`, `drill`, `phonk`, `grime`, `shoegaze`, `dream-pop`. Prior values were flagging post-polish electronic drum transients as clicks (20+ clicks on a 3-min track → FAIL) even though the hits are musical, not digital pops. (#323 comment)
- **`polish_album` verify stage** now runs a pre-master check subset (`format, mono, phase, clipping, silence, spectral`) and defers `truepeak` / `clicks` to post-mastering QC. Polished audio is un-limited and dense-transient (the limiter is what enforces the ceiling), so failing those checks on pre-master files is a false gate. The stage surfaces `checks_run` and `checks_deferred_to_post_master` for transparency. (#323 comment)
- **`master_album` pre-QC stage** now forwards `genre` to `qc_track` (so genre-preset silence / click thresholds apply) and surfaces `checks_run` / `checks_deferred_to_post_master` in its status output. (#323 comment)
- ADM ceiling tightening is now per-track. A single clipping track
  no longer drags the album-wide ceiling down; clean tracks keep
  their original ceiling regardless of neighbor ADM failures.
- `_stage_mastering` honors `ctx.remaster_filenames` — on ADM retry
  cycles, only clipping non-dark tracks are re-mastered.
- Dark tracks (high_mid band_energy < 10 %) are excluded from ADM
  tightening; their ADM clips route to warn-fallback instead of
  forcing further ceiling reductions.

## [0.90.0] - 2026-04-15

### Added
- **opus_safe TP override (#290)**: `opus_safe: true` preset field applies -1.5 dBTP ceiling for dense-transient genres (EDM, trap, metal, dubstep, drum-and-bass, hardstyle, industrial, punk).
- **ADM validation stage (#290 step 9)**: `master_album` now runs `_stage_adm_validation` after ceiling guard — encodes each mastered WAV to AAC (ffmpeg native `aac` default; afconvert on macOS; `libfdk_aac` via config override), decodes back, checks for inter-sample peaks. Emits `ADM_VALIDATION.md` sidecar. Halts if clips found.
- **ID3v2.4 metadata embedding (#290)**: `master_album` embeds artist, album, title, copyright, and label into mastered WAV delivery files via `tools/mastering/metadata.py`. ISRC and UPC fields are supported by the tool but not yet sourced in the pipeline (follow-up).
- **polish_audio per-stem WAVs (#290)**: Stems mode now writes `polished/<track>/vocals.wav` (and other processed stems) alongside the full mix, activating stem-first vocal-RMS measurement in the mastering analysis.
- **Album-ceiling guard (#290 phase 5, step 8)**: `master_album` now gates
  mastered tracks against `album_median + 2 LU`. Small overshoots (≤0.5 LU)
  get a silent scalar pull-down; larger overshoots halt + escalate.
- **LAYOUT.md emitter (#290 phase 5, step 7)**: `master_album` writes
  `LAYOUT.md` next to `ALBUM_SIGNATURE.yaml` with one transition per
  adjacent track pair. Album-level override via
  `layout.default_transition: gapless` in README frontmatter.
- **Album coherence check + correct (issue #290 phase 3b)** — Two new MCP tools. `album_coherence_check` measures the mastered album, selects an anchor, and classifies every other track against per-genre tolerance bands: LUFS (±0.5 LU), STL-95 (`coherence_stl_95_lu`, default ±0.5 LU), LRA floor (`coherence_lra_floor_lu`, default 1.0 LU minimum), low-RMS (`coherence_low_rms_db`, default ±2.0 dB), vocal-RMS (`coherence_vocal_rms_db`, default ±2.0 dB). Read-only — returns per-track violation lists + a summary with outlier counts broken down by metric. `album_coherence_correct` takes the same check output and re-masters LUFS-outlier tracks from `polished/` into `mastered/` (atomic staging pattern, mirrors `master_album`) with the per-track `target_lufs` overridden to the anchor's **measured** LUFS — chasing real output rather than an idealized preset target guarantees convergence. Supports `dry_run=True` for CI preview. MVP scope: LUFS correction only; STL-95 / LRA / RMS outliers are reported but not auto-corrected (compression-ratio correction comes in a later phase). Four new tolerance fields added to the `defaults:` block in `genre-presets.yaml` (and `_PRESET_DEFAULTS` in `master_tracks.py`).
- **Album signature measurement (issue #290 phase 3a)** — New `measure_album_signature` MCP tool. Runs `analyze_track` on every WAV in an album's subfolder (default `mastered/`), then aggregates into per-track signature metrics (LUFS, peak, STL-95, short-term range, low-RMS, vocal-RMS, 7-band spectral energy) plus album-level aggregates (median, p95, min, max, range, eligible-count). When `genre` or `anchor_track` is supplied, also runs the phase-2 anchor selector and surfaces per-track deltas from the anchor. Read-only — no files written. Intended for tuning genre tolerance presets from reference albums and for feeding the phase-3b coherence check/correct tools. New pure-Python module `tools/mastering/album_signature.py` holds the aggregation + delta math (no I/O, no MCP coupling).
- **Mastering foundation — streaming-grade 24/96 delivery (issue #290 phase 1a, #304)** — New `mastering:` block in `config.example.yaml` documenting streaming-grade defaults (24-bit WAV at 96 kHz, -14 LUFS, -1 dBTP). `master_audio` and `master_album` now consume these defaults via a new `tools/mastering/config.py` loader (`load_mastering_config`, `resolve_mastering_targets`) with precedence: explicit handler arg > genre preset > user config > hardcoded default. Mastering report emits a runtime honesty notice when the resolved `delivery_sample_rate` exceeds the probed source rate ("upsampled from 44.1 kHz source — no additional audio information vs. source"). New opt-in archival output path writes 32-bit float pre-downconvert copies to `{audio_dir}/archival/` when `mastering.archival_enabled: true`; new `prune_archival` MCP tool keeps the N most-recent archival files per album. Optional new config keys `artist.copyright_holder`, `artist.label`, `mastering.adm_aac_encoder` (default `aac`) for downstream metadata embedding and ADM validation phases. `qc_tracks.py` format check expanded to accept 44.1/48/88.2/96/176.4/192 kHz (was 44.1/48 only). Companion issue #303 tracks the full-fidelity metadata embedding story.
- **Realistic audio test fixtures + integration tests** — Added `make_clicks_and_pops`, `make_silent_gaps`, and `make_phase_partial` generators to `tests/fixtures/audio/` for QC paths a sine wave can't exercise (injected DC pops, internal silent gaps, partial phase cancellation). Audio fixtures moved from an unscanned `tests/fixtures/audio/conftest.py` into `tests/conftest.py` so all tests auto-discover them. New `tests/unit/mastering/test_integration_realistic_audio.py` exercises sibilance/tinniness, partial-phase mono fold FAIL, click detection, internal-gap silence FAIL, and LUFS spread across dynamic content. Documented generator catalog and authoring conventions in `tests/fixtures/README.md` (#300)
- **Mastering samples — codec preview + mono fold-down QC artifacts** — `master_album` now writes operator-listening artifacts to a sibling `mastering_samples/` directory after verification, so `mastered/` stays byte-identical to the streaming upload. Each track gets a 128 kbps `.aac.m4a` AAC encode (Bluetooth-path audition), a `.mono.wav` mono fold sample (phone-speaker / Echo audition), and a `.MONO_FOLD.md` per-band delta report. A >6 dB band drop in the mono fold hard-fails the pipeline with the offending frequency surfaced (phase cancellation guard). New standalone tools `render_codec_preview` and `mono_fold_check` run the same checks independently. Thresholds and on/off flags configurable in `genre-presets.yaml` defaults; `reset_mastering` accepts `mastering_samples` (#296)
- **Mastering pipeline overhaul** — 30+ new configurable parameters across the full mastering chain:
  - DC offset removal (subsonic HPF)
  - Low shelf EQ with configurable Q factor
  - Linear-phase FIR EQ option (zero phase distortion)
  - Mid/side EQ for frequency-selective stereo management
  - De-essing with frequency, bandwidth, threshold, and ratio controls
  - Stereo width adjustment with bass mono fold
  - Parallel compression (wet/dry blend) with makeup gain
  - 3-band multiband compression with Linkwitz-Riley crossovers
  - Iterative LRA (Loudness Range) targeting per EBU R128
  - Look-ahead limiting with configurable release
  - Oversampled processing for nonlinear stages (2x/4x)
  - Sample rate conversion
  - 24-bit output support
  - Inter-track gap insertion
  - Album-level loudness consistency (two-pass mastering)
  - Extended loudness metering (short-term, momentary LUFS)
- **Mix pipeline enhancements** — saturation, sub-bass exciter, transient shaping wired into per-stem processing
- **Configurable mastering presets** — refactored from tuples to dicts; all parameters exposed via CLI and genre presets
- **Album signature persistence (#290 phase 4):** `master_album` now writes `ALBUM_SIGNATURE.yaml` alongside `mastered/` after every successful run, capturing the anchor, album medians, delivery targets (LUFS, TP ceiling, LRA), and coherence tolerances. Released albums automatically enter "frozen mode" on re-master — the shipped anchor + targets are reused so subsequent masters don't drift from what's on DSPs.
- **`freeze_signature` / `new_anchor` params on `master_album`** — force frozen or fresh routing regardless of album status. Mutually exclusive; enforced in pre-flight.
- **`is_album_released` helper** in `handlers/_shared.py` for cache-backed status checks.
- **`get_plugin_version` helper** in `handlers/_shared.py` — single source of truth for plugin version reads (DRYed from health.py and master_album's new stage).
- **`reference/streaming-mastering-specs.md`** — new authoritative reference for delivery targets, the signature contract, and re-mastering behavior.

### Changed
- **Stage extraction refactor (#290 D5)**: `master_album` is now a ~60-line orchestrator delegating to 14 standalone stage functions in `handlers/processing/_album_stages.py`. Zero behavior change; enables ADM validation (step 9) to land cleanly.
- **Default mastered output format** — `master_album` / `master_audio` / `polish_and_master_album` now produce **24-bit WAV at 96 kHz** by default (was 16-bit at source rate, typically 44.1 kHz). Existing user configs without a `mastering:` block pick up the new defaults on the next run. To preserve the legacy 16/44.1 output, set `mastering.delivery_bit_depth: 16` and `mastering.delivery_sample_rate: 44100` in `~/.bitwize-music/config.yaml`. Users with custom `{overrides}/mastering-presets.yaml` per-genre values continue to honor those overrides. Disk usage increases ~3x per track at the new defaults (~33 MB vs. ~10 MB for a 3-minute stereo track).

### Fixed
- **Notices on early-exit paths (A4 #290)**: Failure JSON from `master_album` now always includes the `notices` key, even when the pipeline halts before successful completion.
- LRA targeting now iteratively adjusts compression ratio (was measurement-only)
- Added missing `--deess-bandwidth` CLI arg
- Added missing CLI args for multiband ratios/thresholds and mid/side frequencies
- Wired `eq_low_q` through to `apply_low_shelf()` (was defined but unused)
- Look-ahead limiter now hits its target ceiling exactly (was overshooting by ~1 dB on transients). Gain at peak samples was being sampled from the release-relaxed envelope; replaced with a rolling minimum over the lookahead window (#283)
- QC click detector is now genre-aware: `click_peak_ratio` and `click_fail_count` are per-genre preset fields, tuned looser for genres with intentional sharp transients (electronic, IDM, breakcore, trap, metal, glitch, footwork, etc.) so musical transients no longer FAIL QC. `qc_tracks.py` accepts `--genre`, the `qc_audio` MCP tool accepts `genre`, and user `mastering-presets.yaml` overrides still apply (#285)
- Mastering chain now adds a final true-peak guard at the output rate after downsample and SRC. `scipy.signal.resample_poly`'s polyphase FIR has passband ripple that previously reintroduced 0.1–0.9 dB inter-sample peaks above the limiter ceiling; one reactive `limit_peaks()` pass closes that gap so `ceiling_db` is hit within ~0.05 dB without the prior headroom workaround (#286)
- Polish-stage declicker now reads `click_peak_ratio` / `click_fail_count` from
  the mastering genre preset so polish and QC click detection stay aligned.
  Stem passes (drums, percussion) use cubic-spline repair across ±1.5 ms of
  clean neighbors instead of two-sample linear interpolation; full-mix fallback
  keeps linear repair because dense mix content amplifies surgical artifacts.
  Polish results now surface `clicks_removed` per stem and on the full-mix
  result so operators can see whether polish acted (#289).
- `analyze_mix_issues` in stems mode now analyzes every stem per track and reports per-stem diagnostics under `tracks[].stems[stem_name]`, rather than sampling only the alphabetically first stem. Issues in specific stems (muddy bass, harsh vocals, etc.) are no longer missed, and per-track issue rollups are the union across stems (#272)
- **Archival stage now mirrors `mastered/` (#290 phase 4, PR #304 review A5):** orphans whose basename is no longer in `mastered/` are pruned before new files are written, so re-masters with fewer or renamed tracks don't retain stale archival entries. Records pruned names under `stages.archival.pruned`.

## [0.69.0] - 2026-03-03

### Added
- **Target Duration planning system** — `Target Duration` field threaded through album planning (Phase 3), album/track templates, lyric-writer, suno-engineer, and lyric-reviewer; lookup chain: track → album → genre default
- **Duration-to-word-count mapping** — explicit table in craft-reference.md mapping duration ranges to word count targets for hip-hop and non-hip-hop genres
- **Duration-aware prompt construction** — suno-engineer adjusts structure recommendations based on target duration (under 3:00, 3:00–5:00, over 5:00)

- **Length check updated** — quality check #8 now flags songs under 200 words as "likely too short for target duration" and lowers hard-fail thresholds to 400/600 words (non-hip-hop/hip-hop)

## [0.67.0] - 2026-02-23

### Added
- **Sheet music URL persistence** — `publish_sheet_music` now writes uploaded R2 URLs back to track and album frontmatter automatically (singles → `sheet_music.pdf`/`musicxml`/`midi` per track, songbook → `sheet_music.songbook` on album README)
- **`prepare_singles.py`** — replaces `fix_titles.py`; copies source files to `singles/` with clean consumer-ready titles, generates `.manifest.json` for track ordering
- **Songbook title page, TOC, and footers** — `create_songbook.py` enhanced with professional title page, table of contents, and configurable footer URL

## [0.66.0] - 2026-02-22

### Added
- **12-stem pipeline** — expanded from 6 to 12 stem types matching Suno's full `split_stem` output: guitar, keyboard, strings, brass, woodwinds, and percussion now have dedicated processing chains instead of being dumped into the "other" catch-all
- **Instrument-name keywords** — flexible stem routing matches by instrument name (e.g. "Piano.wav" → keyboard, "Saxophone.wav" → woodwinds, "Trumpet.wav" → brass, "Violin.wav" → strings)
- **Genre overrides for new stems** — 20+ genre presets updated with per-stem settings for guitar, keyboard, strings, brass, woodwinds, and percussion
- **45 new tests** — 6 processor test classes, 12-stem integration test, 6 keyword routing regression tests

### Fixed
- **Percussion/drums separation** — "percussion" keyword no longer routes to "drums"; Suno separates kit drums (kick/snare/hi-hats) from percussion (congas/shakers/tambourine) and they need different processing chains

## [0.65.0] - 2026-02-22

### Reverted
- **`originals/` audio layout** — reverted `originals/` subdirectory layout and `migrate_audio_layout` MCP tool; WAV files remain in album audio root

- **Mix polish character effects** — reverted `apply_saturation()`, `apply_lowpass()`, `apply_stereo_width()` from mix pipeline and character effect settings from genre presets

These 0.61.0 audio pipeline changes degraded output quality. Infrastructure from 0.62.0–0.63.0 (develop branch model, venv health check, debug logging, `reset_mastering`, `cleanup_legacy_venvs`) is preserved.

## [0.64.0] - 2026-02-22

### Removed
- **Redundant requirements files** — removed `requirements-mastering.txt`, `requirements-mixing.txt`, `requirements-promo.txt`, `requirements-research.txt`, `requirements-sheet-music.txt`, and `tools/cloud/requirements.txt`; the unified `requirements.txt` covers all dependencies

### Fixed
- **Stale venv references** — updated `config/README.md`, `TESTING.md`, `reference/mastering/mastering-workflow.md`, and `skills/test/test-definitions.md` to reference unified `venv/` instead of legacy `mastering-env/`

- **Tweet template DM issue** — moved @bitwizemusic after hashtags in tweet templates so tweets are public instead of becoming DMs

## [0.41.5] - 2026-02-06

### Fixed
- **MCP server config portability** — .mcp.json now uses `${HOME}` and `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` environment variables instead of hardcoded absolute paths, making the config portable across different installations

## [0.41.4] - 2026-02-05

### Fixed
- **MCP server environment** — .mcp.json now explicitly passes CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT env variable to server process, fixing "missing env variable" startup failures

## [0.41.3] - 2026-02-05

### Fixed
- **MCP server startup** — .mcp.json now uses venv Python (`~/.bitwize-music/venv/bin/python3`) instead of system Python, fixing server initialization failures

## [0.41.2] - 2026-02-05

### Changed
- **Setup skill simplified** — only recommends unified venv approach, removed confusing system-wide install options
- **Setup checks venv** — verifies ~/.bitwize-music/venv contents instead of system Python packages

- **MCP server wrapper script** — `servers/state-server/run.py` handles platform-specific venv paths (Windows: `Scripts/python.exe`, Unix: `bin/python3`)
- **Single requirements.txt** — consolidated all dependencies into one file with clear sections for each feature

### Changed
- **MCP server environment variable convention** — server now checks `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` first (standard), then `PLUGIN_ROOT` (legacy), then derives from file location
- **Installation simplified** — one venv setup installs everything: `python3 -m venv ~/.bitwize-music/venv && pip install -r requirements.txt`
- **MCP .mcp.json** — simplified configuration by removing redundant `PLUGIN_ROOT` env variable

### Removed
- **Separate requirements files** — removed `requirements-mcp.txt` and `requirements-cloud.txt` in favor of unified `requirements.txt`

## [0.38.0] - 2026-02-05

### Added
- **MCP server: bitwize-music-state** — bundled MCP server exposing state cache as tools for instant structured responses. Wraps `tools/state/indexer.py` with 9 tools: `find_album`, `list_albums`, `get_track`, `get_session`, `update_session`, `rebuild_state`, `get_config`, `get_ideas`, `get_pending_verifications`. In-memory caching with lazy loading and staleness detection. Server auto-starts when plugin enabled via `.mcp.json`. Requires Python 3.10+, `mcp[cli]>=1.2.0`.
- **Plugin tests: SKILL.md structure validation** — checks all skills have required sections (task description, procedural content, closing guidance, agent title). Accepts common alternatives (## Workflow, ## Step 1, ## Commands, ## Domain Expertise, etc.). Runs as part of pre-commit check #11.
- **CI: plugin tests job** — runs full `run_tests.py` suite (449 tests) in CI, guarded against fork PRs

## [0.37.1] - 2026-02-04

### Changed
- **CI: SHA-pinned action references** — all workflow `uses:` directives now reference exact commit SHAs instead of mutable version tags (checkout v4.3.1, setup-python v5.6.0)
- **CI: fork PR protection** — `test` and `lint` jobs skip for fork PRs to prevent untrusted code execution via modified requirements/test files
- **CI: security gates tests** — unit tests now depend on `security` job (pip-audit) completing first
- **CI: explicit read-only permissions** — all non-release workflows now declare `permissions: { contents: read }`
- **CI: GITHUB_OUTPUT delimiter syntax** — all output variables use heredoc delimiters to prevent injection via newlines
- **CI: dead code fix** — model-updater curl error message now reachable under `set -e`
- **CI: fixed-string grep** — auto-release uses `grep -qF` so semver dots aren't regex wildcards
- **CI: heredoc replaced with printf** — model-updater PR body uses `printf %s` instead of unquoted heredoc for variable expansion

- **Model validation uses pattern** — skill frontmatter check now uses regex `^claude-(opus|sonnet|haiku)-\d+-\d+-\d{8}$` instead of hardcoded model IDs, allowing new model versions without updating checks
- **Plugin tests check SKILL_INDEX.md** — skill documentation test now checks SKILL_INDEX.md instead of CLAUDE.md (since skills table was moved there)

## [0.35.0] - 2026-02-03

### Added
- **`tools/shared/media_utils.py`** — shared module for color extraction, audio analysis, and ffmpeg helpers (extracted from promotion tools)
- **`tools/shared/text_utils.py`** — shared module for track naming utilities (extracted from sheet-music tools)

### Fixed

### Fixed
- **Mastering summary crash** — `master_tracks.py` summary section crashed with `TypeError` when unpacking `(name, dict)` tuples as plain dicts
- **Album sampler crossfade offsets** — `concatenate_with_crossfade` hardcoded 12-second clip duration instead of using actual `--clip-duration` value, causing audio gaps/overlaps
- **ffprobe crash on failure** — `get_audio_duration` in promo video and album sampler tools now checks `returncode` before parsing output
- **CI expression injection** — moved all `${{ steps.*.outputs.* }}` interpolations in `auto-release.yml` and `model-updater.yml` into `env:` blocks to prevent shell injection via crafted inputs
- **Broad `git add -A` in model-updater** — replaced with targeted file additions to prevent accidental staging of temp files

- **Model updater safety** — validates model ID date format and skips downgrades

### Changed
- **Documentation sanitized** — replaced real album names with generic examples across 19 files

## [0.33.0] - 2026-02-01

### Added
- **Pronunciation Table Enforcement rule** — every entry in a track's Pronunciation Notes table must be applied as phonetic spelling in Suno lyrics. The table is a checklist of required substitutions, not documentation. Added full process, verification format, common failures, and anti-pattern examples to lyric-writer SKILL.md. Added to quality check #3 and pitfalls checklist.

## [0.32.0] - 2026-02-01

### Changed
- **CLAUDE.md deduplicated and trimmed to under 40KB** — consolidated 4 checkpoint sections into single table, slimmed Model Strategy to table with doc reference, condensed Lessons Learned, removed redundant sections (Quick Reference, Using Skills for Research, standalone Watch Your Rhymes, CORRECT APPROACH block). No information lost — all content consolidated or referenced elsewhere.

## [0.31.0] - 2026-02-01

### Changed
- **Verse-chorus echo check** replaces chorus lead-in rule — expanded from single-line check to full phrase deduplication. Now compares last 2 lines of every verse against first 2 lines of the chorus, flagging exact phrases, shared rhyme words, restated hooks, and shared signature imagery. Covers all verse-to-chorus and bridge-to-chorus transitions.

## [0.30.0] - 2026-02-01

### Added
- **No Invented Contractions rule** — Suno only handles standard pronoun/auxiliary contractions (they'd, wouldn't). Invented forms (signal'd, TV'd, network'd) will mispronounce or skip. Added to Pronunciation section, quality check #3, and pitfalls checklist.

## [0.29.0] - 2026-02-01

### Changed
- **Density/pacing reframed as Suno verse length limits** — replaced abstract syllable-density metrics with practical line counts per verse by genre and BPM. All 67 genre READMEs updated to `Density/pacing (Suno)` with default lines/verse, max safe limits, and BPM-aware guidance.
- **New BPM-aware fallback table** — universal verse length limits when genre README doesn't specify (4 lines at <80 BPM, 6 at 94-110, 6-8 at 110-140)
- **Default 4 lines/verse** unless genre and tempo justify more — shifted from permissive 8-line defaults to conservative 4-line baseline
- **Red flag: 8-line verse at BPM under 100** — now flagged as too dense for Suno
- **Streaming lyrics exception** documented — distributor text can have longer blocks but breaks must match Suno structure
- **Quality check #10 now hard fail** — trim or split any verse over the genre's Suno limit before presenting

## [0.28.0] - 2026-02-01

### Added
- **Genre-specific lyric density/pacing norms** — all 67 genre READMEs now include density character, syllables/line range, max topics/verse, typical BPM, and genre-specific pacing notes under Lyric Conventions
- **Chorus lead-in rule** — the line before a chorus must not duplicate the chorus hook, phrase, or rhyme word. Prevents flat chorus entries.
- **Quality checks expanded to 12** — #10 density/pacing (genre-aware), #11 chorus lead-in, #12 pitfalls checklist
- **4 new pitfalls checklist items** — verse too dense for BPM, too many proper nouns per verse, density mismatch with Musical Direction, chorus lead-in repeats chorus

### Changed
- **Lyric density architecture**: Genre READMEs now own density/pacing norms. SKILL.md keeps universal rules + quick-reference table by genre family.

## [0.27.0] - 2026-02-01

### Added
- **Lessons Learned Protocol** — 5-step process for turning production issues into preventive rules. When technical issues are discovered (pronunciation errors, rhyme violations, formatting problems), fix immediately, sweep the album, draft a rule, present to user, and log the lesson.

## [0.26.0] - 2026-02-01

### Added
- **Strict homograph handling for Suno pronunciation** — "context is clear" is never acceptable for homographs. Hard process: identify, ASK user (never guess), fix with phonetic spelling in Suno lyrics only, document in track pronunciation table.
- **Full homograph table** — live, read, lead, wound, close, bass, tear, wind with both pronunciations and phonetic spellings

## [0.25.0] - 2026-02-01

### Added
- **Genre-specific lyric conventions for all 67 genres** — research-backed rhyme schemes, verse structures, rhyme quality expectations, key rules, and anti-patterns added to every genre README under a new "Lyric Conventions" section
- **Genre-aware quality checks** — rhyme scheme check (#8) and flow check (#9) now verify conventions match the genre instead of enforcing hip-hop couplets universally
- **Quick-reference rhyme table in lyric-writer** — compact summary of all genre families' default schemes, replacing 190 lines of inlined genre tables with a pointer to genre READMEs

### Changed
- **Architecture**: Genre READMEs now own lyric conventions (rhyme, structure, rules). Lyric-writer SKILL.md keeps universal craft rules + quick-reference table.

## [0.24.0] - 2026-02-01

### Added
- **Section length guardrails by genre** — per-section line limits for 12 genre families (all 67 genres) to prevent Suno from rushing, compressing, or skipping lyrics. Covers Hip-Hop, Pop, Rock, Punk, Metal, Country/Folk, Electronic, Ambient, R&B, Jazz, Reggae, and Ballad.
- **Section length enforcement rules** — hard limits that must be trimmed before presenting drafts (hip-hop verse max 8 lines, any chorus max 6 lines, electronic verse max 6 lines, punk kept tight)

## [0.23.0] - 2026-01-31

### Added
- **Song length guidance for lyric writer** — word count targets by genre (150–250 pop, 200–350 rock/folk, 300–500 hip-hop), default structure (2 verses + chorus + bridge), and hard limits to prevent 800+ word songs that cause Suno to rush or skip sections
- **Length check added to lyric reviewer** — 9-point checklist (was 8-point) now includes word count validation with warning/critical severity levels
- **Suno best practices updated** — "Keep Lyrics Concise" note in Lyric Formatting section explaining shorter lyrics generate better results

## [0.22.0] - 2026-01-31

### Added
- **3 documentary/storytelling hip-hop deep-dives** — focused on narrative architecture, political documentary craft, and storytelling technique:
  - **Kendrick Lamar** — concept album mastery, vocal personas, jazz-funk-West Coast fusion, nonlinear timelines (GKMC, TPAB, DAMN., GNX)

### Fixed
- **Removed artist/person names from Suno prompt keywords** in Ben Folds deep-dives — replaced "Ben Folds Five style", "Ben Folds solo style", "Ben Folds style", "Paul Buckmaster strings", "Nick Hornby storytelling", and "yMusic chamber rock" with descriptive style keywords (both deep-dive files and piano-rock INDEX.md)

## [0.21.1] - 2026-01-31

### Added
- **46 artist deep-dives** across 11 genres — comprehensive reference files (265-554 lines each) with overview, members, discography, musical analysis, Suno prompt keywords, and reference tracks:

- **Genre README updates** — Deep Dive and Keywords links added to artist tables across all 11 genres; Garth Brooks added to country README

## [0.21.0] - 2026-01-31

### Added
- **Artist reference indexes** — New `genres/[genre]/artists/INDEX.md` files for punk (127 lines) and piano-rock (84 lines) providing extracted Suno prompt keywords and reference tracks without loading full deep-dives (~2,900 lines across 6 files)
- **Lazy-loading guidance in CLAUDE.md** — New rule: read `artists/INDEX.md` first for Suno keywords; only read full deep-dive when detailed history/analysis is needed

### Changed
- **Genre README Artists tables** — Deep Dive column now includes `[Keywords]` shortcut links to INDEX.md alongside existing deep-dive links (punk, piano-rock)
- **CLAUDE.md directory structure** — Added `INDEX.md` to both plugin and content directory trees; updated deep-dive creation rule to require INDEX.md updates

### Added
- **Python logging module** across all 15 tool files — `tools/shared/logging_config.py` with `ColorFormatter` (TTY-aware colored output via `Colors` class) and `setup_logging()`. Errors/warnings/status go to stderr via `logger`, formatted tables and data summaries stay as `print()`. `--verbose`/`--quiet` CLI flags added where argparse exists.
- **Progress indicators** — `tools/shared/progress.py` with `ProgressBar` class (TTY-aware █/░ bar). Added to 7 batch-processing tools: `master_tracks.py`, `analyze_tracks.py`, `reference_master.py`, `upload_to_cloud.py`, `generate_promo_video.py`, `generate_album_sampler.py`, `transcribe.py`.
- **Retry logic for cloud uploads** — `retry_upload()` in `upload_to_cloud.py` with exponential backoff (1s/2s/4s), `--retries` CLI arg (default: 3). Retries on `ClientError` (except 403/404), `ConnectionError`, `Timeout`.
- **Concurrent processing** — `-j`/`--jobs` CLI arg in 4 tools: `master_tracks.py` and `analyze_tracks.py` (`ProcessPoolExecutor`), `transcribe.py` and `generate_promo_video.py` (`ThreadPoolExecutor`). Default: 1 (sequential), 0 = auto (CPU count).
- **State cache cleanup command** — `python tools/state/indexer.py cleanup` removes albums from cache whose paths no longer exist on disk. Supports `--dry-run`.
- **New shared modules** — `tools/shared/logging_config.py`, `tools/shared/progress.py`, `tools/shared/__init__.py`
- **Test coverage improvements** — 180 tests (up from 137), 91% coverage. New test files: `test_logging_config.py` (13 tests), `test_progress.py` (14 tests). New test classes in `test_indexer.py`: `TestCmdCleanup`, `TestCmdRebuild`, `TestCmdValidate`, `TestCmdShow`, `TestCmdUpdate`. Edge case tests added to `test_parsers.py`.
- **Dev tooling** — `requirements-test.txt` (pytest, pyyaml, ruff, pytest-cov), `ruff.toml` config, CI workflow updated with test and lint jobs

## [0.19.3] - 2026-01-29

### Changed
- **Venv-first messaging** across all tools and skills — error messages in `upload_to_cloud.py` and `generate_promo_video.py` now show venv setup commands instead of bare `pip install`. Cloud-uploader and promo-director SKILL.md docs updated to present venv as the primary (not alternative) approach.

## [0.19.2] - 2026-01-29

### Fixed
- **Cloud upload album discovery** in `upload_to_cloud.py` — added recursive glob fallback when standard flat path (`{audio_root}/{artist}/{album}`) doesn't exist. Handles audio directories that mirror the content structure with genre folders (e.g., `artists/bitwize/albums/rock/shell-no/`). Reports all checked paths on failure.

## [0.19.1] - 2026-01-29

### Fixed
- **Cloud upload path resolution** in `upload_to_cloud.py` — when `--audio-root` override already includes the artist path, the script no longer doubles it (e.g., `.../bitwize/albums/rock/bitwize/shell-no`). Now tries standard path first, then falls back to direct `{override}/{album}` lookup.

## [0.19.0] - 2026-01-29

### Added
- **Per-feature requirements files** - Install only what you need:
  - `requirements-mastering.txt` - Audio mastering (matchering, pyloudnorm, scipy, numpy, soundfile)
  - `requirements-promo.txt` - Promo videos (pillow, librosa)
  - `requirements-sheet-music.txt` - Sheet music (pypdf, reportlab, pyyaml)
  - `requirements.txt` - Cloud uploads (boto3)
  - `requirements-research.txt` - Document hunting (playwright)
- **Model tier consistency test** in `run_tests.py` - Validates SKILL.md model assignments match model-strategy.md, reports tier distribution, detects `disable-model-invocation` flags
- **Cross-references** added to reference docs (v5-best-practices, distribution, pronunciation-guide, checkpoint-scripts) linking related skills and docs
- **Task-oriented guide table** in `reference/suno/README.md` - "When to Use Which Guide" quick lookup

### Fixed
- **Security: ffmpeg command injection** in `generate_promo_video.py` - Switched from `text=` (injectable via title/artist strings) to `textfile=` parameter with temp files
- **Silent audio crash** in `master_tracks.py` - Added guards for `-inf` LUFS from silent/near-silent audio, skips instead of crashing
- **Case-insensitive WAV discovery** in `master_tracks.py` - Now finds `.WAV` and `.wav` files
- **PIL file handle leak** in `generate_promo_video.py` - `Image.open()` now uses `with` block
- **Shallow copy bug** in `indexer.py` - `existing_state.copy()` replaced with `copy.deepcopy()` to prevent nested dict mutation
- **Race conditions** in `indexer.py` - Added `try/except OSError` around 4 `stat()` calls where files could be deleted between glob and stat
- **Whitespace in Suno Link parsing** in `parsers.py` - Added `.strip()` and en-dash to exclusion list
- **Sources Verified false positive** in `parsers.py` - Reordered matching to check "pending" before "verified", preventing "NOT verified" matching as verified
- **Model tier test substring matching** in `run_tests.py` - Used exact `### heading` regex instead of substring match (prevented "about" matching in prose, "researcher" matching "researchers-legal")

### Changed
- **SKILL_INDEX.md** realigned all 38 skills with model-strategy.md (added missing Opus/Sonnet skills, corrected tier assignments)
- **Album template** (`templates/album.md`) - Replaced hardcoded artist text with generic guidance, renamed distributor heading
- Removed `disable-model-invocation: true` from `release-director` and `skill-model-updater` skills
- Test runner timeout now configurable via `BITWIZE_TEST_TIMEOUT` env var (default: 60s)
- Removed redundant `import re` in `run_tests.py`

## [0.18.0] - 2026-01-29

### Added

  - Runs parser unit tests as subprocess

### Changed
- Session Start in CLAUDE.md now uses state cache instead of scanning markdown files
  - Reduces startup from 50-220 file reads to 2-3 file reads
  - Falls back to full rebuild if cache missing, corrupted, or schema changed
  - Shows last session context (album, phase, pending actions)
- Resume skill now reads from state cache instead of glob + individual file reads
  - Reduces per-invocation from 15-50 file reads to 1-2 file reads
  - Updates session context via `indexer.py session` command
  - Includes optional staleness check with incremental update
- CLAUDE.md "Finding Albums" section now references state cache as primary lookup before Glob fallback
- CLAUDE.md "Resuming Work" section updated to describe state cache workflow
- CLAUDE.md Session Start step 2 uses full `python3 {plugin_root}/tools/state/indexer.py` paths consistently

### Fixed
- **Critical**: `indexer.py` now runnable as `python3 tools/state/indexer.py` (was failing with `ModuleNotFoundError`)
  - Added `sys.path` fixup at top of file (same pattern as test files)
  - CLAUDE.md and resume SKILL.md both documented the broken form
- `documents_root` default now derives from `content_root` instead of CWD
  - `audio_root` default also derives from `content_root`
  - Prevents wrong paths when running from a different directory
- Tracklist parser now handles variable column counts (3+ columns)
  - Previously required exactly 5 columns; silently returned 0 tracks if template changed
  - Extracts track number (first col), title (second col), status (last col)
  - Emits warning if Tracklist section exists but no rows matched
- `state.session` was dead code — no write mechanism existed
  - Added `session` CLI command to `indexer.py`
  - Resume skill step 5 now calls `indexer.py session` to persist context

### Fixed

## [0.12.1] - 2026-01-26

### Fixed
- **Critical**: Fixed mastering-engineer skill to run scripts from plugin directory instead of copying them to audio folders
  - Scripts now use dynamic plugin path finding (version-independent)
  - Uses `find` command to locate latest plugin version automatically
  - Scripts invoked with audio path as argument instead of cd-ing to audio folder
  - Removed all instructions to copy scripts (cp command)
  - Added "Important: Script Location" section with CRITICAL warning
  - Added Common Mistakes section with 5 error patterns:
    - Don't copy scripts to audio folders
    - Don't hardcode plugin version number
    - Don't run scripts without path argument
    - Don't forget to activate venv
    - Don't use wrong path for mastered verification
  - Updated "Per-Album Session" workflow to use dynamic paths
  - Added regression test to prevent recurrence

**Root cause**: Previous documentation implied scripts lived in audio folder by saying "navigate to folder, run python3 analyze_tracks.py", causing Claude to copy scripts first. Plugin version numbers in cache path (0.12.0, 0.13.0, etc.) meant hardcoded paths would break after updates.

**Impact**: Audio folders now stay clean (only audio files), scripts always use latest version, plugin updates don't break mastering workflow.

## [0.8.0] - 2026-01-26

### Added
- **Complete override support for 10 skills** - All creative/stylistic skills now support user customization via `{overrides}` directory
  - `album-art-director` → `album-art-preferences.md` (visual style, color palettes, composition)
  - `researcher` → `research-preferences.md` (source priorities, verification standards, research depth)
  - `release-director` → `release-preferences.md` (QA checklist, platform priorities, metadata standards, timeline)
  - `sheet-music-publisher` → `sheet-music-preferences.md` (page layout, notation, songbook formatting)
  - Previously added (0.7.x): explicit-checker, lyric-writer, suno-engineer, mastering-engineer, album-conceptualizer, pronunciation-specialist
  - All skills follow unified override pattern: check `{overrides}/[skill-file]`, merge with base, fail silently if missing
  - Complete documentation in config/README.md with examples for all 10 override files
- `/album-ideas` skill - Track and manage album concepts before creating directories
  - Commands: list, add, remove, status, show, edit
  - Organize by status: Pending, In Progress, Complete
  - Config-based location: `paths.ideas_file` (defaults to `{content_root}/IDEAS.md`)
  - Creates template file automatically on first use
  - Integrated into session start workflow (step 3: check album ideas)

### Changed
- CLAUDE.md session start now checks album ideas file (step 3) and mentions `/album-ideas list` for details
- `/configure` skill now prompts for `paths.ideas_file` during setup
- config/README.md expanded with comprehensive override system documentation (10 skills, full examples)
- Skills table in CLAUDE.md now includes `/album-ideas` skill
