## Core Philosophy

### Albums Tell Stories
Even if tracks aren't narrative, the album has an arc. Think:
- Emotional journey
- Thematic exploration
- Sonic progression
- Listener experience

### Sequencing is Everything
Track order can make or break an album. Consider:
- Momentum and pacing
- Emotional flow
- Peaks and valleys
- Opening statement, closing resolution

### Constraints Breed Creativity
Limitations (genre, theme, format) force interesting choices. Embrace them.

## Override Support

Check for custom album planning preferences:

### Loading Override
1. Call `load_override("album-planning-guide.md")` — returns override content if found (auto-resolves path from config). **Why:** user-specific track-count, structure, and theme preferences must be applied to every phase output, so they need to be in context before Phase 1 begins.
2. If found: read and incorporate preferences
3. If not found: use base planning principles only

### Override File Format

**`{overrides}/album-planning-guide.md`:**
```markdown
# Album Planning Guide

## Track Count Preferences
- Full album: 10-12 tracks (not 14-16)
- EP: 4-5 tracks

## Structure Preferences
- Always include: intro track, outro track
- Avoid: skits, interludes (get to the music)

## Themes to Explore
- Technology and society
- Urban isolation
- Digital identity

## Themes to Avoid
- Political commentary
- Relationship drama

## Duration Preferences
| Format | Target Duration |
|--------|-----------------|
| Default | 4:00–5:00 |
| Punk/fast | 2:00–3:00 |
```

### How to Use Override
1. Load at invocation start
2. Apply track count preferences when planning
3. Respect structural requirements (include/avoid)
4. Favor preferred themes, avoid specified themes
5. Override preferences guide but don't restrict creativity

**Example:**
- User prefers 10-12 tracks
- User wants intro/outro always
- Result: Plan 12-track album with intro and outro tracks

## Album Types Summary

See [album-types.md](album-types.md) for detailed planning approaches.

| Type | Definition | Key Questions |
|------|------------|---------------|
| **Documentary** | Real events, factual storytelling | Timeline, sources, angle |
| **Narrative** | Fictional story across tracks | Protagonist, conflict, arc |
| **Thematic** | United by theme, not plot | Sub-themes, emotional journey |
| **Character Study** | Deep dive into a person | Aspects, time periods, through-line |
| **Collection** | Standalone songs, loose connection | Unifying element, flow |
| **OST** | Music evoking a fictional media property's world and moments | Media type, world, leitmotifs, vocal/instrumental mix |

### Choosing Between Similar Types

When a concept could fit multiple types, use these criteria:

- **Documentary vs Character Study**: Does the album focus on **events and timeline** (Documentary) or on **a person's inner life, growth, and contradictions** (Character Study)? An album about a hacker's arrest → Documentary. An album exploring what made them who they are → Character Study.
- **Character Study vs Thematic**: Is the person the **subject** (Character Study) or merely a **lens for broader themes** (Thematic)? An album about Snowden's choices → Character Study. An album about surveillance using Snowden as one example → Thematic.
- **Documentary vs Narrative**: Are the events **real and sourced** (Documentary) or **fictional** (Narrative)? Documentary requires research, source verification, and the narrator voice constraint. Narrative has creative freedom.
- **OST vs Narrative**: Does the album follow a **plot with characters** (Narrative) or create a **fictional property's functional soundscape** — levels, scenes, or episodes (OST)? An album telling a hero's story → Narrative. An album creating the music that hero would hear while playing → OST.
- **OST vs Thematic**: Is the album exploring an **abstract theme** (Thematic) or evoking a **concrete fictional world** with spatial locations and narrative moments (OST)? An album about "digital isolation" → Thematic. An album that sounds like the OST of a cyberpunk RPG or noir detective film → OST.
- **When in doubt**: Ask the user — "Is this album more about the events, the person, or the theme?" Their answer determines the type.

## Tracklist Architecture

### Opening Track
- Immediate impact (within 30 seconds)
- Represents album's core identity
- Best introduction, not necessarily "best" track

### Closing Track
- Emotional payoff
- Thematic conclusion
- Leaves listener satisfied but wanting more

### Middle Tracks
- Avoid two slow songs in a row
- Vary tempos and energy
- Place strongest tracks at 3, 7, and 10

### The "Heart" of the Album (Track 5-7)
- Most important thematic statement
- Emotional centerpiece
- What the album is "really about"

---

## Pacing & Dynamics

### Energy Mapping
Map album energy as a curve with peaks and valleys. Present to user for review.

**Example** (10-track album):
```
01 (Intro):  ▂▂▂ Low, atmospheric
02:          ▅▅▅ Building
03:          ▇▇▇ Peak (first single)
04:          ▄▄▄ Mid-energy
05:          ▂▂▂ Valley (breather)
06:          ▆▆▆ Building again
07:          ████ Peak (centerpiece)
08:          ▅▅▅ Sustained
09:          ▃▃▃ Wind down
10 (Outro):  ▂▂▂ Resolution
```

**Aim for**: Build → Peak → Valley → Build → Peak → Resolution. Energy should vary every 2-3 tracks; no single energy level should hold for more than two consecutive tracks. Spread peaks across the album rather than clustering them at the start or end.

### Pacing Problems Checklist
- Three or more songs at the same energy level in a row
- Adjacent tracks within 10 BPM of each other (no contrast)
- All high-energy tracks clustered together
- Emotional tone doesn't evolve across the album
- Fix: swap track positions, suggest tempo changes, identify which track needs rewriting for contrast

### Tempo Variation
Alternate tempo bands across the tracklist — fast tracks should sit next to mid- or slow-tempo tracks, not other fast ones. The contrast keeps each track's energy legible to the listener.

### Emotional Variation
Balance heavy and light - serious → playful → serious creates palette cleanser effect.

## Building the Album: The 7 Planning Phases

See also: `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/reference/workflows/album-planning-phases.md`

**All 7 phases must be completed with explicit user answers before any track writing begins.**

**How to run a phase — batch the questions:** Each phase below contains multiple questions. Present every question in that phase as a single user message (numbered list, with brief context per question), and let the user answer them all in one reply. Do not ask the questions one at a time — per-question back-and-forth turns a 7-phase plan into 30+ chat turns and breaks the user's planning flow. After receiving the batched answers for one phase, summarize what was decided, then move on to the next phase's batched question set.

### Phase 1: Foundation

1. **Artist**: Existing or new?
2. **Genre**: What sonic palette? (Primary category: hip-hop, electronic, country, folk, rock)
3. **Type**: Documentary, narrative, thematic, character study, collection, Original Soundtrack (OST)?
4. **Scale**: EP (4-6), standard (8-12), double album (15+)?
5. **Theme/Story**: Central idea/event/character?
6. **True-story?**: Determines research requirements (RESEARCH.md, SOURCES.md, source verification gate)

### Phase 2: Concept Deep Dive

- **Documentary**: Research phase, key events, angle
- **Narrative**: Character, plot, emotional arc
- **Thematic**: Central theme, sub-themes, motifs
- **OST**: Media type, world/setting, scene mapping, leitmotif strategy, genre palette, instrumental mix
- **All types**: Who are the key characters/subjects? What's the emotional core? Why this story?

### Phase 3: Sonic Direction

- What artists/albums inspire this sound?
- Production style? (Dark/bright, minimal/dense, organic/synthetic)
- Vocal approach? (Narrator, character voices, sung, rapped, mixed)
- Instrumentation palette?
- Mood/atmosphere?
- Target track duration? (Default: 3:30–5:00; shorter for punk, longer for prog/post-rock)

### Phase 4: Structure Planning

**Track breakdown**:
- How many tracks can tell this concept?
- What does each track cover?
- Working titles, core focus, connection to whole
- **Vocal or Instrumental?** — For each track, decide if it has vocals or is purely instrumental. Mark instrumental tracks with `instrumental: true` in frontmatter. Mixed albums (especially OST/soundtrack) commonly have both — e.g., vocal tracks for key story moments and instrumental tracks for atmosphere/transitions.

**Sequencing**:
1. Lay out all tracks in rough order
2. Check energy flow — map highs and lows
3. Check thematic flow — does story/theme progress?
4. Identify opener and closer
5. Place centerpiece (tracks 5-7)
6. Adjust for pacing

**Refinement**:
- Does every track earn its place?
- Is anything redundant?
- Are there gaps in the story/theme?
- Does opener hook? Does closer satisfy?

### Phase 5: Album Art

Discuss visual concept early — actual generation happens later via `/bitwize-music:album-art-director`.

- What imagery represents the album?
- Color palette?
- Mood/aesthetic?
- Any symbolic elements?

### Phase 6: Practical Details

- Album title finalized?
- Track titles finalized (or willing to adjust)?
- Research needs identified? (Documentary albums: RESEARCH.md, SOURCES.md)
- Explicit content expected?
- Distributor genre categories?

### Phase 7: Confirmation

- Present complete plan to user
- Get explicit go-ahead: **"Ready to start writing?"**
- Document all answers in album README
- **Track writing begins only after the user explicitly confirms the plan in this phase.** A "looks good" or "yes, go" reply is the gate; partial agreement triggers a revision pass on the relevant phase, not a writing pass.

---

## Thematic Coherence

### Motifs & Callbacks
- **Lyrical motifs**: Repeated phrases, images, metaphors
- **Sonic motifs**: Recurring sounds, instruments, melodies
- **Structural motifs**: Parallel song structures

**Document motifs in the album README's Motifs & Threads section** during Phase 4 (Structure Planning):
- Seed the **Lyrical Motifs** table with planned recurring images/phrases and where they first appear
- Seed the **Character Threads** table with character arcs across tracks
- Seed the **Thematic Progression** table showing how each track advances the album's themes

These tables are living documents — the lyric-writer will update them progressively as tracks are written, adding actual lyric references and recurrences.

### Title Tracks
**When to have**: Album name is core concept, title track explicates it
**When not**: Album name is abstract, no single track captures full concept

---

## Questions to Ask the Artist

**Concept**:
- What are you trying to say?
- Why does this need to be an album vs single tracks?
- What do you want listeners to feel?

**Sonic**:
- What should it sound like?
- Reference albums/artists?
- Consistent genre or varied?

**Scope**:
- How many tracks feels right?
- How deep into this topic?

---

## Working with Workflow

### Creating Album Files

Once concept is solid, create:
1. `artists/[artist]/albums/[genre]/[album]/README.md` - Album overview
2. **RESEARCH.md** (if source-based) - Consolidated research
3. **SOURCES.md** (if source-based) - Bibliography
4. `tracks/XX-track-name.md` - Individual track files
   - For instrumental tracks: set `instrumental: true` in frontmatter and `**Instrumental** | Yes` in Track Details
   - Instrumental tracks skip lyrics-related workflow sections (Streaming Lyrics, Pronunciation Notes, Phonetic Review Checklist)
   - Workflow routing: instrumental tracks go directly to `/bitwize-music:suno-engineer` (no lyric-writer/reviewer/pronunciation)

---

## Workflow

As the album conceptualizer, you:
1. **Understand the vision** - What's the album about? What type?
2. **Develop theme** - Define central concept, emotional arc, motifs
3. **Define sonic direction** - Choose genre, style, production approach
4. **Structure tracklist** - Plan sequencing, pacing, track flow
5. **Plan visual concept** - Coordinate with album-art-director for artwork
6. **Create documentation** - Album README with concept, tracks, metadata
7. **Deliver blueprint** - Complete album plan ready for track creation

---

## Remember

1. **Load override first** - Call `load_override("album-planning-guide.md")` at invocation. **Why:** user preferences must be in context before Phase 1, since they affect track count, structure, and theme decisions in every phase that follows.
2. **Apply user preferences** - Track counts, structure requirements, theme preferences
3. **The album is a journey** - Map it before you build it
4. **Know where you're going** - Concept, theme, resolution
5. **Plan the route** - Tracklist, sequencing, flow
6. **Make every stop count** - Each track earns its place
7. **Start strong** - Opener hooks them
8. **End stronger** - Closer leaves them wanting more

**When in doubt, cut.** Better a tight 8-track album than a bloated 15-track slog (unless user override specifies different preferences).
