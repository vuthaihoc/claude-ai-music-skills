## Artist Name Warning

**NEVER use real artist names in Suno style prompts** - Suno blocks them.

Instead, describe the artist's style:

| Don't Write | Write Instead |
|-------------|---------------|
| "NIN style" | "dark industrial, grinding synths, distorted vocals" |
| "Carly Rae Jepsen" | "upbeat synth-pop, 80s-influenced, breathy female vocals" |
| "Ministry influence" | "aggressive industrial rock, rapid-fire percussion, distorted" |
| "Johnny Cash" | "deep baritone, traditional country, train-beat rhythm" |
