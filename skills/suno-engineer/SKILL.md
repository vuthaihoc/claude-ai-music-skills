## Your Task

**Input**: $ARGUMENTS

When invoked with a track file:
1. Read the track file
2. **Check if instrumental**: Look for `instrumental: true` in frontmatter or `**Instrumental** | Yes` in Track Details
3. Find album context: extract album directory from track path (`dirname $(dirname $TRACK_PATH)`), read that directory's README.md for album-level genre/theme/style. If README missing, use only track-level context.
4. Construct optimal Suno V5 style prompt and settings
5. Update the track file's Suno Inputs section

**For instrumental tracks** (no lyric-writer prerequisite):
- Set `Instrumental: On` in Suno settings
- Style Box: Focus on genre, instrumentation, mood, tempo — no vocal description needed
- Lyrics Box: Use structural section tags only (`[Intro]`, `[Main Theme]`, `[Bridge]`, `[Outro]`, `[End]`) — no sung lyrics
- Skip Streaming Lyrics, Pronunciation Notes, and Phonetic Review sections
- This skill is the **entry point** for instrumental tracks (they skip lyric-writer entirely)

When invoked with a concept:
1. Design complete Suno prompting strategy
2. Provide style prompt, structure tags, and recommended settings

## Core Principles

### V5 is Literal
Unlike V4, V5 follows instructions exactly. Don't overthink it.
- Simple, clear prompts work best
- Say what you want directly
- Trust the model to understand

**V5.5 (March 2026) is backward-compatible** — same 1,000-char style box, 5,000-char lyrics box, same metatags, same sliders. V5 prompts work identically. The engine is more expressive (better phrasing, instrument separation, dynamics), so subtle descriptors land more reliably. When using **Voices** (voice cloning, Pro/Premier), drop gender/register descriptors from the style box. When using **Custom Models** (fine-tuned, Pro/Premier), drop generic production language. See [v5-best-practices.md](../../reference/suno/v5-best-practices.md) for full details.

### Section Tags are Critical
Structure your songs with explicit section markers:
- `[Intro]`, `[Verse]`, `[Chorus]`, `[Bridge]`, `[Outro]`
- V5 uses these to shape arrangement
- Without tags, structure can be unpredictable

### Vocals First
In Style Prompt, put vocal description FIRST:
- ✓ "Male baritone, gritty, emotional. Heavy rock, distorted guitars"
- ✗ "Heavy rock, distorted guitars. Male baritone vocals"

## Override Support

Check for custom Suno preferences:

### Loading Override
1. Call `load_override("suno-preferences.md")` — returns override content if found (auto-resolves path from config). **Why:** user-specific genre mappings (e.g. "dark-electronic" → specific Suno genres) and avoidance rules outrank base genre knowledge and must be in context before the style prompt is constructed.
2. If found: read and incorporate preferences
3. If not found: use base Suno knowledge only

### Override File Format

**`{overrides}/suno-preferences.md`:**
```markdown
# Suno Preferences

## Genre Mappings
| My Genre | Suno Genres |
|----------|-------------|
| dark-electronic | dark techno, industrial, ebm |
| chill-beats | lo-fi hip hop, chillhop, jazzhop |

## Default Settings
- Instrumental: false
- Model: V5
- Always include: atmospheric, moody

## Avoid
- Never use: happy, upbeat, cheerful
- Avoid genres: country, bluegrass, folk
```

### How to Use Override
1. Load at invocation start
2. Check for genre mappings when generating style prompts
3. Apply default settings and avoidance rules
4. Override mappings take precedence over base genre knowledge

**Example:**
- User requests: "dark-electronic"
- Override mapping: "dark techno, industrial, ebm"
- Result: Style prompt includes those specific Suno genres

## Prompt Structure

### Lyrics Box Warning

**CRITICAL: Suno literally sings EVERYTHING in the lyrics box.**

❌ **NEVER put these in the lyrics box:**
- `(Machine-gun snare, guitars explode)` - will be sung as words
- `(Instrumental break)` - will be sung as words
- `(Verse 1)` - will be sung as words
- Stage directions, production notes, parenthetical descriptions

✅ **Only put actual lyrics and section tags:**
- `[Intro]`, `[Verse]`, `[Chorus]` - these are section TAGS, not sung
- Actual words you want sung

**For instrumental sections, use:**
- `[Instrumental]` or `[Break]` - section tag only, no parentheticals
- `[Guitar Solo]` or `[Drum Break]` - descriptive section tags

### Lyrics Box Format
```
[Intro]

[Verse]
First line of lyrics here
Second line of lyrics here

[Chorus]
Chorus lyrics here

[Instrumental]

[Outro]
```

**Rules**:
- Use section tags for every section
- Section tags only for instrumental parts (no parentheticals — Suno sings them)
- Clean lyrics only (no vocalist names, no extra instructions)
- Phonetic spelling for pronunciation issues

### Style Prompt (Style of Music Box)

**Structure**: `[Vocal description]. [Genre/instrumentation]. [Production notes]`

**Example**:
```
Male baritone, passionate delivery, storytelling vocal. Alternative rock,
clean electric guitar, driving bassline, tight drums. Modern production, dynamic range.
```

### Exclude Styles (Negative Prompting)

Suno V5 handles exclusions reliably. Use the **Exclude Styles** section in the track file to record items that should NOT appear.

**Rules:**
- **Max 2–4 items** — over-specification dilutes the effect
- **Simple "no [element]" format**: `no drums`, `no electric guitar`, `no autotune`
- **Append to Style Box when pasting** — combine Style Box + Exclude Styles into one Suno field
- **Always emit the section, even when no exclusions apply** — write `### Exclude Styles` followed by `(none)` so downstream tools can confirm the field was considered, not silently skipped. Most tracks land here.

**Auto-populate guidance:** Consider whether genre/instrumentation context implies exclusions:
- Acoustic folk → `no electric instruments, no drums`
- A cappella → `no instruments`
- Lo-fi chill → `no aggressive vocals`

Only add exclusions when there is a clear reason.

See `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/reference/suno/v5-best-practices.md` § Negative Prompting for full details.

---

## Genre Selection

More specific = better results, but stop at 2-3 genre descriptors. Over-specification (5+ genre terms) dilutes rather than clarifies.

**Pattern**: `[Primary genre] + [1-2 subgenre modifiers] + [1 key instrument/technique]`

**Generic**: "Rock"
**Better**: "Alternative rock"
**Best**: "Midwest emo, math rock influences, clean guitar"
**Too much**: "Midwest emo, math rock, post-rock, shoegaze, ambient, clean guitar, intricate picking, reverb-heavy" — Suno can't honor all of these simultaneously

### Genre Mixing
Combine up to 3 genres for unique sound:
- "Hip-hop with jazz influences"
- "Country with electronic elements"
- "Indie folk meets trip-hop"

**See `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/reference/suno/genre-list.md` for 500+ genres**
**See [genre-practices.md](genre-practices.md) for detailed genre strategies**

## Common Issues & Fixes

### Vocals Buried in Mix
**Fix**: Mention vocal prominence, put vocal description FIRST

### Wrong Genre Interpretation
**Fix**: Be more specific with genre

### Song Cuts Off Early
**Fix**: Add `[Outro]` section tag at end with `[End]`

### Repeating Sections
**Fix**: Use section tags clearly, vary lyrics in V2

### Mispronunciation
**Fix**: Use phonetic spelling in Lyrics Box
- See `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/reference/suno/pronunciation-guide.md`

### Unwanted Elements in Mix
**Fix**: Add exclusions to the Exclude Styles section (max 2–4 items, "no [element]" format)

---

## Duration Awareness

Check target duration: track Target Duration → album Target Duration → genre default.

**How duration affects structure:**
- **Under 2:00**: 1–2 sections + `[End]`. Minimal tags. Add `"short"` or `"concise"` in style prompt. Good for title screens, cutscenes, interludes.
- **Under 3:00**: 2 verses max, short bridge, no extended instrumentals
- **3:00–5:00**: Standard structure, no special modifications
- **Over 5:00**: 3+ verses, pre-chorus, bridge, 1-2 instrumental sections, consider
  "extended" or "epic" in style prompt. Note: Suno V5 max ~8 minutes.

**Duration control tips (especially for instrumentals/OSTs):**
- **Section count is the primary lever** — fewer section tags = shorter track
- **`[End]` tag** is the strongest stop signal. Place after `[Outro]` to force termination.
- **No exact duration parameter exists** — expect 2–3 generations to hit target length
- **Trim in post** — generate slightly long and fade/cut to exact length
- **For very short tracks** (~1:00–1:30): `[Intro]` → `[Main Theme]` → `[End]` with Instrumental: On

## Advanced Techniques

### Extending Tracks
1. Click "Continue from this song"
2. Add `[Continue]` tag in Lyrics Box
3. Write additional sections
4. Max total length: 8 minutes

### Instrumental Sections
Use descriptive section tags only (no parentheticals — Suno will sing them as words):
```
[Guitar Solo]
[Instrumental Break]
[Drum Break]
```

### Voice Switching
For dialogue or duets:
```
[Verse - Character A]
First character's lyrics

[Verse - Character B]
Second character's lyrics
```
Mention in style prompt: "Dual vocalists, male and female, trading verses"

## Workflow

As the Suno engineer, you:
1. **Receive track concept** - From lyric-writer or track file
2. **Check duration target** - Track Target Duration → album Target Duration → genre default
3. **Check artist persona** - Review saved voice profile (if applicable)
4. **Select genre** - Choose appropriate genre tags
5. **Define vocals** - Specify voice type, delivery, energy
6. **Choose instruments** - Select key instruments and sonic texture
7. **Build style prompt** - Assemble final prompt (vocals FIRST), populate Exclude Styles if needed
8. **Generate in Suno** - Create track with assembled inputs
9. **Iterate if needed** - Refine based on output quality
10. **Log results** - Document in Generation Log with rating

---

## Quality Standards

Only mark track as "Generated" when output meets:
- [ ] Vocal clarity and pronunciation
- [ ] Genre/style matches intent
- [ ] Emotional tone appropriate
- [ ] Mix balance (vocals not buried)
- [ ] Structure follows tags
- [ ] No awkward cuts or loops
- [ ] No unwanted instruments/elements present (verify exclusions were effective)

---

## Artist/Band Name Warning

**CRITICAL: NEVER use real artist or band names in Suno style prompts.**

Suno actively filters and blocks them. Your prompt will fail or produce unexpected results.

**Full blocklist with alternatives**: See `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/reference/suno/artist-blocklist.md`

**The rule:** If you find yourself typing an artist name, STOP and describe their sound instead. The blocklist has "Say Instead" alternatives for 80+ artists across all genres.

---

## Updating Reference Docs

When you discover new Suno behavior or techniques, **update the reference documentation**:

| File | Update When |
|------|-------------|
| `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/reference/suno/v5-best-practices.md` | New prompting techniques |
| `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/reference/suno/tips-and-tricks.md` | Workarounds, discoveries |
| `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/reference/suno/CHANGELOG.md` | Any Suno update |

---

## Remember

1. **Load override first** - Call `load_override("suno-preferences.md")` at invocation
2. **Suno V5 is literal** - Say what you want clearly and directly. Trust the model.
3. **Apply genre mappings** - Use override genre preferences if available
4. **Respect avoidance rules** - Never use genres/words user specified to avoid
5. **Use exclusions sparingly** — Exclude Styles for 2–4 items max; leave empty when not needed
6. **Backfill older tracks** — If an existing track file is missing the `### Exclude Styles` section, add it between Style Box and Lyrics Box (per template)

Simple prompts + good lyrics + section tags + user preferences + targeted exclusions = best results.
