# TEST CATEGORIES

## 1. CONFIG TESTS (`/test config`)

Tests for the configuration system.

### TEST: config.example.yaml exists
```
Glob: config/config.example.yaml
```

### TEST: config.example.yaml is valid YAML
```bash
~/.bitwize-music/venv/bin/python3 -c "import yaml; yaml.safe_load(open('${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/config/config.example.yaml'))"
```

### TEST: config.example.yaml has all required sections
Read config/config.example.yaml and verify these top-level keys exist:
- `artist:`
- `paths:`
- `urls:`
- `generation:`

### TEST: config.example.yaml has all required fields
Verify these fields exist:
- `artist.name`
- `paths.content_root`
- `paths.audio_root`
- `paths.documents_root`
- `generation.service`

### TEST: config.example.yaml has all optional fields documented
Verify these optional fields exist and are documented:
- `paths.overrides` (overrides directory for skill customization)
- `paths.ideas_file` (album ideas tracking file)

### TEST: config.example.yaml has inline examples (quick win #9)
Read config/config.example.yaml.
Verify it includes commented examples for:
- artist.name (examples of artist names)
- artist.genres (examples of genre choices)
- artist.style (examples of style descriptions)
- paths.content_root (path pattern examples)

Verify inline comments use "Examples:" or "Example:" format

### TEST: config/README.md exists and documents all settings
1. Read config/README.md
2. Verify it documents each setting from config.example.yaml
3. Check Settings Reference table is complete

### TEST: Config location consistently documented as ~/.bitwize-music
Search these files for config path references:
- CLAUDE.md
- README.md
- config/README.md
- skills/configure/SKILL.md
- skills/tutorial/SKILL.md

All should reference `~/.bitwize-music/config.yaml` or `~/.bitwize-music/`

### TEST: Config must be read before path operations (regression)
Read CLAUDE.md "When to Read Config" section.
Verify it includes:
1. "ALWAYS read" instruction before moving/creating files
2. "ALWAYS read" instruction before resolving paths
3. "Do not assume or remember values" instruction
4. Reference to context summarization as reason to re-read

This test was added after paths were incorrectly resolved because config values were assumed instead of read.

### TEST: No references to old config files
Search entire repo (excluding .git/) for deprecated references:
- `config/paths.yaml`
- `config/artist.md`
- `paths.example.yaml`
- `artist.example.md`

---

## 2. SKILLS TESTS (`/test skills`)

Tests for skill definitions and documentation.

### TEST: All skill directories have SKILL.md
```bash
for dir in skills/*/; do
  [[ -f "${dir}SKILL.md" ]] || echo "MISSING: ${dir}SKILL.md"
done
```

### TEST: All skills have valid YAML frontmatter
For each skills/*/SKILL.md:
1. First line is `---`
2. Has closing `---`
3. Contains required fields

### TEST: All skills have required frontmatter fields
Each SKILL.md must have:
- `name:` (required)
- `description:` (required)
- `model:` (required — tier alias preferred, see below)
- `effort:` (required on Opus/Sonnet skills; omit on Haiku — see below)
- `allowed-tools:` (required, must be array)

### TEST: Skills with external deps have requirements field
Skills that require external tools or Python packages should have `requirements:` in frontmatter.

Required for:
- `mastering-engineer` - needs matchering, pyloudnorm, scipy, numpy, soundfile
- `promo-director` - needs ffmpeg, pillow, librosa
- `sheet-music-publisher` - needs AnthemScore, MuseScore, pypdf, reportlab
- `document-hunter` - needs Playwright, chromium
- `cloud-uploader` - needs boto3

Check with:
```bash
for skill in mastering-engineer promo-director sheet-music-publisher document-hunter cloud-uploader; do
  if ! grep -q "^requirements:" "skills/$skill/SKILL.md"; then
    echo "MISSING: skills/$skill/SKILL.md needs requirements field"
  fi
done
```

### TEST: All model references are valid
Each skill's `model:` field MUST use a **tier alias** so it automatically tracks
the frontier model of that tier (no per-release edits):
```
opus | sonnet | haiku
```
The special values `inherit` / `default` are also accepted. Pinned model IDs
(e.g. `claude-opus-4-8`) are **rejected** — use an alias.

Examples of valid models:
- `opus`
- `sonnet`
- `haiku`

Check with:
```bash
for f in skills/*/SKILL.md; do
  model=$(grep -E '^model:' "$f" | sed 's/model: *//')
  if ! echo "$model" | grep -qE '^(opus|sonnet|haiku|inherit|default)$'; then
    echo "INVALID: $f has model: $model"
  fi
done
```

### TEST: Effort levels are valid and correctly scoped
Skills may set an `effort:` field (reasoning depth). Rules:
- If present, the value must be one of: `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`, `max`.
- **Opus/Sonnet** skills must set an effort level (these tiers honor it).
- **Haiku** skills must NOT set effort — Haiku does not support it, so the field
  would be a misleading no-op.

`xhigh` is only honored on Opus 4.7/4.8; on Sonnet it gracefully falls back to
`high`. `max` is honored on all Opus/Sonnet tiers. See the
[effort docs](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/model-config.md#adjust-effort-level).

Check with:
```bash
for f in skills/*/SKILL.md; do
  model=$(grep -E '^model:' "$f" | sed 's/model: *//')
  effort=$(grep -E '^effort:' "$f" | sed 's/effort: *//')
  case "$model" in
    *opus*|*sonnet*) [ -z "$effort" ] && echo "MISSING effort: $f" ;;
    *haiku*) [ -n "$effort" ] && echo "UNSUPPORTED effort on haiku: $f" ;;
  esac
  if [ -n "$effort" ] && ! echo "$effort" | grep -qE '^(low|medium|high|xhigh|max)$'; then
    echo "INVALID effort: $f has effort: $effort"
  fi
done
```

```

This checks:

If this test fails:
- Add missing skill to CLAUDE.md skills table (alphabetically)

- Update CHANGELOG.md

**Note:** This is critical - if a skill isn't in the help system, users can't discover it!

### TEST: No deprecated terminology

   ```bash
   ls -1 genres/
   ```
2. Search for genre references in templates and documentation:
   - `templates/album.md` - genre field examples
   - `skills/new-album/SKILL.md` - genre parameter
   - `CLAUDE.md` - genre examples
3. Any genre referenced in examples must exist in `genres/` directory
