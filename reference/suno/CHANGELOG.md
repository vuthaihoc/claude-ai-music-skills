## 2026-04-12 - V5.5 Research Update

### Features
- **Voices** (Pro/Premier, 4 credits/creation, 18+): voice cloning from 15s–4min of singing with spoken-phrase consent verification; activation requires a broad training-consent opt-in
- **Custom Models** (Pro/Premier, up to 3/account): fine-tune private V5.5 on ≥6 original tracks; 2–5 minute build time
- **My Taste** (all tiers including free): passive preference learning that shapes the style autogenerate feature

### Changes
- **Engine**: improved phrasing nuance, instrument separation, dynamic range, vocal expressiveness — subtle descriptors land more reliably
- **Backward compatibility**: style box (1,000 chars), lyrics box (5,000 chars), metatags, structure tags, sliders, negative prompting all unchanged from V5. No deprecated patterns.
- **Optional prompting adjustments**: drop gender/register descriptors when using Voices; drop generic production language when using Custom Models

### Documentation
- Retitled v5-best-practices.md to cover V5 and V5.5
- Added V5.5 Update summary section at top of v5-best-practices.md
- Added Voices & Custom Models section to v5-best-practices.md
- Added V5.5 personalization summary to tips-and-tricks.md
- Updated suno-engineer skill description to reflect V5/V5.5 scope

## 2026-02-04 - V5 Best Practices Research Update

### Features
- **Personas**: Documented creation workflow, best practices, Persona+Cover combinations, December 2025 dominance update
- **Song Editor**: Section-level editing (remake, rewrite, extend, reorder, delete) without full regeneration
- **Bar Count Targeting**: Syntax for targeting specific bar counts per section (e.g., `[VERSE 1 8]`)
- **Creative Sliders**: Weirdness, Style Influence, Audio Influence — documented usage guidance

### Community Tips
- **Prompt fatigue / tag soup**: V5 dilutes attention with 8+ descriptors; sweet spot is 4–7
- **Top-Loaded Palette formula**: `[Mood] + [Energy] + [2 Instruments] + [Vocal Identity]`
- **Token biases**: Suno gravitates toward Neon, Echo, Ghost, Silver, Shadow — model preference, not creative choice
- **Producer's Prompt approach**: Narrative descriptions outperform flat tag lists in V5
- **Sustained notes**: `Loooove`, `Ohhhh` for vocal emphasis; ALL CAPS for shouting
- **Emotion arc mapping**: Different vocal qualities per section for dynamic performance
- **Language isolation**: One language per section for multilingual tracks prevents drift
- **Numbers**: Spell out numbers for reliable pronunciation

### Changes
- **V4.5 comparison note**: V4.5 may produce better results for heavy genres (metal, hardcore)
- **Ownership clarification**: Post-WMG deal — "commercial use rights" but not ownership; model deprecation planned for 2026
- **Catalog protection warning**: Download important generations before licensed models launch
- **V5 Voice Gender selector**: Advanced Options selector documented as most reliable gender control
- **IPA not supported**: Confirmed IPA is not natively supported by Suno
- **V5 context sensitivity**: Improved but phonetic spelling still required for homographs

### Documentation

- Updated tips-and-tricks.md: Personas workflow, Covers+Personas, Song Editor, Creative Sliders, catalog protection, expanded WMG context
